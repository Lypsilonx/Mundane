### Vision

My vision for this role playing ruleset is to enable players to go on whacky, dark and fucked-up adventures that border on insanity and make no physical sense.\
This ruleset will be built for short form parody-like adventures or satire and puts creativity, improvisation and comedy first.

To keep this experience attached to a somewhat coherent story, we need rules.

## Building a character

### Moods

Every character has a mood circle that is filled with 20 emotional states/intentions they can be in:

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### (S)ad
You focus on the negative or want to be left alone.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### (I)ndifferent/Bored
You are bored or just plain ignorant of your surroundings.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### (F)ocused/Relaxed
You are in a state of zen or tunnel-focussed on achieving something.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### (E)xcited/Happy
You focus on the positive or are highly motivated.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### (P)rideful
You are very arrogant or know everything better than everyone else.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### (R)omantic/Horny
You want to be intimate with someone in your general vicinity or need romantic attention.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### (A)nnoyed/Aggressive
It appears that nothing is going as planned, or the whole world is against you.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### (M)urderous
You just really want to kill something right now.

Moods are [partially determined by the class of the character](#classes). How they are set on the mood circle is up to the player.

Various actions in the world can have an effect on the current active mood, from shifting to flipping.\
The GM will tell you when to apply which changes. If they don’t, you can ask them to do it when you feel your mood would change.\
For these changes, mood is counted clockwise.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Mood Shift
Roll a d4:

1 = -2\
2 = -1\
3 = +1\
4 = +2

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Possible Causes (Mood Shift)
- The character meeting an [NPC](#npcs)
- The character entering a new section of the map/room
- …

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Mood Flip
Your mood is now the one opposite to your current mood (+/- 10)

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Possible Causes (Mood Flip)
- Someone [dying](#character-lifespan)
- Someone [revealing an ability](#revelations)
- …

Each character has to act according to their mood when role-playing.

By setting up your mood circle, you can control how mentally stable your character will be. A gradient from Sad to murderous (as listed [above](#moods)) would make them stable. Mixing the moods up will make them react wild and cause sudden changes in mood.

<hr>

### Importance

This determines what happens when your character [dies](#character-lifespan).

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Bystander
The bystander character is someone that is sucked into the story by accident.\
No one cares about them to the point that they can just resurrect after death, and no one realizes that they have met this character before.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Support Role
Dies the death of a hero and inspires other characters, giving everyone surrounding them **+1 on their first check in your spirit**. You can create a new character or take over an NPC the GM doesn’t particularly care about.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Main character
Has plot armor and basically cannot die.\
If they die, the GM or the Player can think of any reason why they survived anyway.

<hr>

### Classes

Every character must have **two classes** and gets the combined moods (4 each[^1]) from them. The 12 remaining moods are chosen by the player.

[^1]: The moods use the abbreviations defined in the chapter [Moods](#moods) and are written out in a 4 character string below each class

A player might also build a charter of **pure** class that gains every bonus twice[^2].

[^2]: +1 → +2; Once per session → Twice per session; Choose a → choose two

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Protector
Gain a +1 to your rolls when rolling in favor of anything/anyone but themselves.\
Can choose a protectee[^3] and will not die as long as that being/object is still alive/not broken.[^4]

[^3]: Once per session

[^4]: That person or object has to stay within a reasonable distance of them

FPRA

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Pilot
+1 on any check trying to get into or out of trouble.\
Can mount/steer/pilot anything without any problems.\
(Pure bonus: you will always be able to find a mount somewhere close)

FEPP

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Crafter
+1 on any check against inanimate objects.\
Has a bonus [revelation](#revelations) specific to crafting something.

FEEA

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Charmer
+1 on any check when being nice.\
Once a session, can make friends with any sentient being.

SERR

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Commander
+1 on any check when being in charge.\
If other sentient beings follow their command, they get +1 on checks related to that command.

IFPA

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Brute
+1 on any check against another sentient being.\
They also do +1 damage when they are angry or murderous.

AAMM

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Scientist
+1 on any check with the goal of finding something out.\
Can ask the GM for a hint once a session.

SIFE

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Acrobat
+1 on any check that relies on your physique.\
+2 on any check that is [impossible](#ability-checks).

## Playing the game

### Revelations

Each session, a character can reveal a part of their backstory, granting them an ability that they can choose at that moment.

Revealed abilities should not feel game breaking. The GM can intervene if they feel like “this didn’t happen” and fail the revelation.

After an ability is successfully revealed, it can be used throughout the rest of the game.

<hr>

### NPCs

NPCs are either indestructible or weak. There is no middle ground.\
They can reward you for finishing [milestones](#milestones) or add their own (optional) milestones to the campaign.

<hr>

### Character Lifespan

Characters have 3 states of health they can be in:

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Fine
You are not hurt in any way.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Hurt
Ouch!

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Dying
’tis but a scratch!

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Dead
Well…

When **failing an ability check against someone who has succeeded an ability check** wanting to hurt you, you enter the next stage (or any stage after that if you want to). When you die, look at your [importance](#importance) for the next steps.

<hr>

### Fights

Players act in (reverse) order of their mood ([Murderous to Sad](#moods)).\
Each round, they have **two sentences** to explain what they will be doing.\
If necessary, they will have to succeed in an [ability check](#ability-checks) to see if their plan works out.\
They can also use their turn to [reveal](#revelations) something. This takes up all of their turn (even if it “didn’t happen”), but they get to explain it in full.

<hr>

### Ability checks

Ability checks only depend on 3 factors.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### The die roll
You roll a d10.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Your role-play
If the action you are taking is [within the current mood](#moods) of your character, get +1 to your roll.\
If you have a (good?) explanation for how your character is achieving their goal, get +1 to your roll.\
Apply [class related bonuses](#classes).\
If [a support role died](#support-role), apply their bonus.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### The difficulty
The factor X depends on the difficulty of the challenge. It can vary from **easy (2)** to **impossible (11)**.

If the resulting number is greater or equal to X, you succeed.\
(You can always have your character fail if you want them to.)

<hr>

## Campaings

Campaigns consist of [a starting point](#the-starting-point) and [milestones](#milestones).

<hr>

### The starting point

Your adventure needs to start somewhere. As a GM you need to decide where to place your groups characters to start of the adventure.\
A good starting point already sets the campaign of with a challenge that needs to be tackeled.

<hr>

### Milestones

Milestones describe things, that need to happen for the story to end/the party to be successful.\
These could be noteable moments from your favourite book, movie, series or game, or just some things you want to see your players acomplish.

These milestones can be fulfilled in **any order and by any means**. Sometimes keeping them vague could result in unexpected situations.

<hr>

### Enemies

As GM, you can always just make a character and throw them into the mix against your players’ party.\
For boss enemies, you can expand their health-pool or bind them taking damage to specific actions the characters have to take.[^5]

[^5]: Destroying some sort of magical object, or making blood sacrifices…

You can also introduce one-life cardboard soldiers at any time. They can try to do something against your party, but à la stormtrooper-aim, they won’t succeed very often. Just roll a d6 for each of them and let them hit on a 6.

<hr>

### Example Campaign

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Starting Point

The Shire

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Milestones
- The party sets off
- …
- A tree talks
- Gandalf dies
- …
- The orcs kill
- …
- The ring is destroyed

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Result
The party meets and immediately calls for the giant eagles to take them to the mountain, where they get Gandalf to swallow the ring and jump into the volcano.\
As they arrive in the magical forest on the way back, they feast on the cooked eagles, who were killed by orcs. But there are no ents… why would there be ents?… no, these are just trees… But then Gandalf reappears as Gandalf the wise and invents a magic dung that makes trees sentient.\
The end.

<hr>

### Other

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### What about magic?
Depending on your setting and character build, you may be able to use magic more easily. In general, you can always try to use magic, but it might be an [impossible check](#the-difficulty) for your average Stormtrooper.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### What do I do against characters who have become too powerful?
Due to the way the fights work, it should not be possible for any player to really do more damage. You can also always make tragedy/fate strike… as the GM you have ultimate control over the setting, and this ruleset should also make it easier for you to just go wild with the challenges in response to such players.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### How do I make it even crazier?
You could introduce aspects, that do not align with your established world building. Make Alien ships appear in a medieval setting, or have a unicorn pop up on a spaceship.
