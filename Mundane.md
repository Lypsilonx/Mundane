## Vision

My vision for this role playing ruleset is to enable players to go on whacky, dark and fucked-up adventures that border on insanity and make no physical sense.\
This ruleset will be built for short form parody-like adventures or satire and puts creativity, improvisation and comedy first.

To keep this experience attached to a somewhat coherent story, we need rules.

<hr>

## Requirements

To play the game you need at least one player and a game master (GM).\
The game is played in sessions (Times when you meet to play), where the GM will guide the players through a story.\
Every player will role-play as their character in the GMs story and make decisions for them.\
The GM will have to direct the story and decide on the outcome of the players decisions.

The Players will each need to [build a character](#building-a-character).\
The game master needs to [set up a campaign](#setting-up-a-campaingn).\
The game master should have read and understood all the rules before starting to play.

<hr>

## Building a Character

Characters in Mundane have an [importance](#importance), two [classes](#classes), [specialisations](#specializations) and 20 [moods](#moods).\
The following chapters will teach you how to build a character step by step.

First, you will need an idea for a character. Depending on how your GM wants to play, they might have already told you a genre, movie, series or book, your character will be part of in the game.\
When you have thought of a character, take out a piece of paper and write their name on it. This is your **character sheet**.

<hr>

### Importance

This mostly determines what happens when your character [dies](#character-lifespan), but also how they are seen by other characters and [NPC's](#npcs) in-game.\
Choose one of the following and write it down on your character sheet.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Bystander
The bystander character is someone that is sucked into the story by accident.\
No one cares about them to the point that they can just resurrect after death, and no one realizes that they have met this character before.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Support Role
Dies the death of a hero and inspires other characters, giving everyone surrounding them **+1 on their first check in their spirit**. They can create a new character or take over an NPC the GM doesn’t particularly care about. The GM can also decide to resurrect them if they feel like it.
Support roles [SP](#specializations) can add up to 2 (or lower).

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Main Character
Has plot armor and basically cannot die.\
If they die, the GM or the Player can think of any reason why they survived anyway.

<hr>

### Classes

Every character must have **two classes**.\
You can also build a charter of **pure** class that gains every bonus twice[^1].

[^1]: +1 → +2; Once per session → Twice per session; Choose a → choose two

Write down two of the following classes on your character sheet. You can ignore the Moods column for now.

| Class          | Description | Moods |
| :------------- | :---------- | ----: |
| Protector      | +1 on any check when rolling in favor of anything/anyone but them.<hr>Can choose a protectee[^2] and will not die as long as that being/object is still alive/not broken.[^3] | FPRA |
| Pilot          | +1 on any check trying to get into or out of trouble.<hr>Can mount/steer/pilot anything without any problems.<hr>(Pure bonus: they will always be able to find a mount somewhere close) | FEPP |
| Crafter        | +1 on any check against inanimate objects.<hr>Has a bonus [revelation](#revelations) specific to crafting something. | FEEA |
| Charmer        | +1 on any check when being nice.<hr>Once a session, can make friends with any sentient being. | SERR |
| Commander      | +1 on any check when being in charge.<hr>If other sentient beings follow their command, they get +1 on checks related to that command. | IFPA |
| Brute          | +1 on any check against another sentient being.<hr>They also do +1 damage when they are angry or murderous. | AAMM |
| Scientist      | +1 on any check with the goal of finding something out.<hr>Can ask the GM for a hint once a session. | SIFE |
| Acrobat        | +1 on any check that relies on their physique.<hr>+2 on any check that is [impossible](#ability-checks). | IEEP |

[^2]: Once per session

[^3]: That person or object has to stay within a reasonable distance of them

<hr>

### Specializations

Every character can have any number of specialisations [^4] from the list below, plus any the GM may add themselves.

[^4]: Though it is not advised to pick too many, as it might get difficult to keep track of all your characters kinks.

Write down any specializations, that you want for your character on your character sheet. The sum of specialization points (SP) will have to add up to 0 (or lower) at the end.

#### Boni
| Specialization    | Description | SP |
| :---------------- | :---------- | -: |
| Neat              | <hr>        |    |
| Bookworm          | Your character can always exclaim "I've read about this...!" and on a successfull [ability check](#ability-checks) the GM will have to tell you something useful about the thing they've "read about". | +1 |
| Happy pills       | Once a session you can set your characters [mood](#moods) to any mood you want. | +1 |
| Convenient        | <hr>        |    |
| Masochist         | Whenever your character takes [damage](#character-lifespan) they have advantage[^5] on their next [ability check](#ability-checks). | +2 |
| Beginners Luck    | Your character has advantage[^5] on any [ability check](#ability-checks) concerning something they have never done before. | +2 |
| Useful            | <hr>        |    |
| Special interest  | You can choose a **topic X** that your character is particularly interested in. They will always succeed in [ability checks](#ability-checks) concerning **topic X**. | +3 |
| Threatening glare | In a [fight](#fights) your characters party acts first. | +3 |
| Powerful          | <hr>        |    |
| Lucky Bastard     | You can reroll any [ability check](#ability-checks) once, if you want, but the last result counts. | +4 |
| Call bullshit     | Once per session your character can call bullshit on something, and the GM will have to change it. | +4 |
| Game changing     | <hr>        |    |
| Secret Plot/Plan  | Your character has an extra [revelation](#revelations) that they can reveal at any time.<br>(Not available for [crafters](#crafter)) | +5 |

[^5]: Roll two d10 and take the better result.

#### Mali
| Specialization      | Description | SP |
| :------------------ | :---------- | -: |
| Inconvenient        | <hr>        |    |
| Skill/Knowledge gap | Whenever your character tries to [check](#ability-checks) for something concerning a **topic X**, that you choose on character creation, they will automatically fail the check. | -1 |
| Maniac              | On a [mood shift](#mood-shift) you will have to go anti-clockwise or clockwise on your characters mood circle depending on, which resulting mood is lower in the [mood list](#moods).<br>(If your character is a [brute](#brute) this is a +2 Bunus) | -1 |
| Dangerous           | <hr>        |    |
| Not prepared        | When a [fight](#fights) starts your character must skip their first turn. | -2 |
| Hyperfocus          | Each [check](#ability-checks) your character has to decide which of their [class bonuses](#classes) they want to apply. They can only apply one.<br>(Not available for [pure classes](#classes)) | -2 |
| Risky               | <hr>        |    |
| On the run          | Your character is being persued by a **party X**[^6] of your choosing. At some point in the session (Whenever the GM thinks it appropriate) they will turn up and try to arrest/kill/etc. your character. | -3 |
| Target on their back| In a [fight](#fights), enemies will always attack your character first if possible. | -3 |
| Dangerous           | <hr>        |    |
| Bad Memory          | The GM can change **one thing** about your character at any time. | -4 |
| Clumsy              | If your character fails an [ability check](#ability-checks) you will have to roll another d10, and they will take 1 [damage](#character-lifespan) on a 1. | -4 |
| Suicidal            | <hr>        |    |
| Fragile             | Your character will always take 2 [damage](#character-lifespan) instead of 1. | -5 |

[^6]: Particularily funny, if their genre does not match the current setting.

<hr>

### Moods

There are 8 possible moods:

| Mood                 | Description |
| :------------------- | :---------- |
| (S)ad                | They focus on the negative or want to be left alone. |
| (I)ndifferent/Bored  | They are bored or just plain ignorant of their surroundings. |
| (F)ocused/Relaxed    | They are in a state of zen or tunnel-focussed on achieving something. |
| (E)xcited/Happy      | They focus on the positive or are highly motivated. |
| (P)rideful           | They are very arrogant or know everything better than everyone else. |
| (R)omantic/Horny     | They want to be intimate with someone in their general vicinity or need romantic attention. |
| (A)nnoyed/Aggressive | It appears that nothing is going as planned, or the whole world is against them. |
| (M)urderous          | They just really want to kill something right now. |

Every character has a mood circle[^7] that is filled with 20 moods.\
8 of them are determined by the characters [classes](#classes) (They are written out in a 4 character string in the "Moods" column behind each [class](#classes)).
You can freely choose the other 12. How they are set on the mood circle is also up to you.\
You will have to role-play according to your characters current mood.

[^7]: To track your characters current mood, you can use a d20 and a list of enumerated moods, or list the moods out in a circle and use a token.

By setting up your charcaters mood circle, you can control how mentally stable they will be. A gradient from Sad to murderous (as listed [above](#moods)) would make them stable. Mixing the moods up will make them react wild and cause sudden [changes in mood](#changing-moods).

<hr>

### Example Characters

Here are some examples for how your character sheet could look like. We left the moods out, as they would mostly clutter the table.

| Name                | Importance     | Classes                | Specializations | Moods |
| :------------------ | :------------- | :--------------------- | --------------: | ----: |

## Playing the Game

The following chapters explan concepts you will need to understand to play the game.

<hr>

### Ability Checks

When a character wants to do something that is not trivial the GM can decide to have them face an ability check. If this check succeeds, the character will have achieved their goal.\
Ability checks only depend on 3 factors.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### The die roll
You roll a d10.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Your role-play
If the action your character is taking is [within their current mood](#moods), you get +1 to your roll.\
If you have a (good?) explanation for how your character is achieving their goal, you get +1 to your roll.\
Apply [class related bonuses](#classes).\
If [a support role died](#support-role), apply their bonus.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### The difficulty
The difficulty factor X of the challenge is declared by the GM. It can vary from **easy (2)** to **impossible (>10)**.\
If the resulting number is greater or equal to X, your character succeeds.\
(You can always have your character fail if you want them to.)

The GM can decide if they want to announce the difficulty or if they want to wait for your result and then explain what is happening to your character.

<hr>

### Revelations

Each session, a character can reveal a part of their backstory, granting them an ability that they can choose at that moment.

Revealed abilities should not feel game breaking. The GM can intervene if they feel like “this didn’t happen” and fail the revelation.

After an ability is successfully revealed, it can be used throughout the rest of the game.

<hr>

### Fights

[Enemies](#npcs) act first, except if the GM decides otherwise[^8].\
Player characters act in (reverse) order of their mood ([Murderous to Sad](#moods)).\
When it's your chracters turn, you have to explain what your character will do.\
If necessary, they will have to succeed in an [ability check](#ability-checks) to see if their plan works out.\
They can also use their turn to [reveal](#revelations) something. This takes up all of their turn (even if it “didn’t happen”), but they get to explain it in full.

[^8]: If the player party surprises the enemies (they set up an ambush or something similar), they can act first.

<hr>

### Character Lifespan

Characters generally have 3 hit points[^9] (HP).

[^9]: (3) Fine, (2) Injured, (1) Dying, (0) Dead

Your character takes damage when:
- Someone declares they want to hurt your character
- They succeed an [ability check](#ability-checks)
- Your charcter fails an [ability check](#ability-checks)

Your character then looses one HP[^10]. If your character dies, look at their [importance](#importance) for the next steps.

[^10]: You can always decide to let your character take more damage if you want to.

<hr>

### Changing Moods

Various actions in the world can have an effect on your characters current active mood, from [shifting](#mood-shift) to [flipping](#mood-flip).\
The GM will tell you when to apply which changes. If they don’t, you can ask them to do it when you feel your chracters mood would change.\
For these changes, mood is counted clockwise.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Mood Shift
Roll a d4:

1 = -2\
2 = -1\
3 = +1\
4 = +2

Change your characters mood by the number you rolled. If you are tracking with a d20, remember, that due to the nature of the mood circle, 20 + 1 = 1 and 1 - 1 = 20.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Possible Causes (Mood Shift)
- The character meeting an [NPC](#npcs)
- The character entering a new section of the map/room
- …

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Mood Flip
Your charcters mood is now the one opposite to their current mood (+/- 10)

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Possible Causes (Mood Flip)
- Someone [dying](#character-lifespan)
- Someone [revealing an ability](#revelations)
- …

<hr>

## Setting up a Campaingn

Campaigns consist of [a starting point](#the-starting-point) and [milestones](#milestones).
The following chapers are directed towards the GM.

<hr>

### The Starting Point

Your adventure needs to start somewhere. As a GM you need to decide where to place your groups characters to start of the adventure.\
A good starting point already sets the campaign of with a challenge that needs to be tackeled.

<hr>

### Milestones

Milestones describe things, that need to happen for the story to end/the party to be successful.\
These could be noteable moments from your favourite book, movie, series or game, or just some things you want to see your players acomplish.

These milestones can be fulfilled in **any order and by any means**. Sometimes keeping them vague could result in unexpected situations.

<hr>

### NPCs

NPCs are either [cardboard soldiers](#cardboard-soldiers) or are built like [player characters](#building-a-character).\
They can reward the player party for finishing [milestones](#milestones) or add their own (optional) milestones to the campaign.\
Optional milestones can disapear if the NPC dies.

#### Boss Enemies
For boss enemies, you can expand their [health-pool](#character-lifespan) or bind them taking damage to specific actions the characters have to take.[^11]

[^11]: Destroying some sort of magical object, or making blood sacrifices…

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Cardboard Soldiers
Cardboard soldiers have one HP and cannot protect themselves. They can try to do something against your party, but à la stormtrooper-aim, they won’t succeed very often. Just roll a d6 for each of them and let them hit on a 6.

<hr>

### Example Campaign

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Starting Point

The Shire

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Milestones
- The party sets off
- …
- A tree talks
- Gandalf dies
- …
- The orcs kill
- …
- The ring is destroyed

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Result
The party meets and immediately calls for the giant eagles to take them to the mountain, where they get Gandalf to swallow the ring and jump into the volcano.\
As they arrive in the magical forest on the way back, they feast on the cooked eagles, who were killed by orcs. But there are no ents… why would there be ents?… no, these are just trees… But then Gandalf reappears as Gandalf the wise and invents a magic dung that makes trees sentient.\
The end.

<hr>

### Other

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### What about magic?
Depending on your setting and character build, your characters may be able to use magic more easily. In general, they can always try to use magic, but it might be an [impossible check](#the-difficulty) for your average Stormtrooper.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### What do I do against characters who have become too powerful?
Due to the way the fights work, it should not be possible for any player to really do more damage. You can also always make tragedy/fate strike… as the GM you have ultimate control over the setting, and this ruleset should also make it easier for you to just go wild with the challenges in response to such players.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### How do I make it even crazier?
You could introduce aspects, that do not align with your established world building. Make Alien ships appear in a medieval setting, or have a unicorn pop up on a spaceship.
